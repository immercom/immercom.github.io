<strong>Title</strong>: Imagining the next generation of wireless networks<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: As 5G takes to the airwaves, we now turn our imagination to the next generation of wireless technology. The promise of this technology has created an international race to innovate, with significant investment by government as well as industry. And much innovation is needed as 6G aspires to not only support significantly higher data rates than 5G, up to 100 Gbps, but also improved reliability along with excellent coverage indoors and out, including for underserved areas. New architectures including edge computing must be designed to drastically enhance efficient resource allocation while also reducing latency for real-time control. Breakthrough energy-efficiency architectures, algorithms and hardware will be needed so that wireless devices can be powered by tiny batteries, energy-harvesting, or over-the-air power transfer. There are many technical challenges that must be overcome in order to make this vision a reality. This talk will describe what the wireless future might look like along with some of the innovations and breakthroughs required to realize this vision.<br/>

<strong>Title</strong>: Decoding Hidden Worlds: Wireless &amp; Sensor Technologies for Oceans, Health, and Robotics <br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: Many of us grew up witnessing technology transform science fiction into everyday reality. Yet, as researchers and practitioners, we often assume that we have to make a choice between exploring scientific ideas that fascinate us and pursuing technologies with immediate practical impact. We also strive to transition our research to real-world adoption, often questioning how it fits within the bigger scheme of the world’s most pressing problems from healthcare to climate change. Through my academic and entrepreneurship journey, I realized that we don’t have to make a choice between these aspirations. <br/>
In this talk, I will share new technologies that came out of my journey of weaving together the realms of engineering, science fiction, and societal impact. First, I will describe a new generation of underwater sensor networks for exploring the underwater world. Our devices can sense, compute, communicate, and learn in underwater environments without requiring any batteries - paving the way for long-term ocean monitoring with important applications in climate/weather prediction, marine biology, and aquaculture (seafood production). Next, I will talk about new wireless technologies for sensing the human body, both from inside the body (via batteryless micro-implants) as well as from a distance (for contactless cardiovascular and stress monitoring), and describe how they unlock novel diagnostic and treatment methods. Finally, I will highlight our work on extending robotic perception beyond line-of-sight, and how we designed new RF-visual primitives for robotics - including sensing, servoing, navigation, and grasping - to enable new manipulation tasks that were not possible before. <br/>
The talk will cover how we designed and built these technologies, and how we work with medical doctors, climatologists, oceanographers, and industry practitioners to deploy them in the real world. I will also highlight the open problems and opportunities for these technologies, and how researchers and engineers can build on our open-source tools to help drive them to their full potential in addressing global challenges in climate, health, and automation.<br/>
<strong>Speaker Bio</strong>: Fadel Adib is the Doherty Chair at MIT and Associate Professor in the MIT Media Lab and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He is the founding director of the Signal Kinetics group which invents wireless and sensor technologies for networking, health monitoring, robotics, and ocean IoT. He is also the founder &amp; CEO of Cartesian Systems, a spinoff from his lab that focuses on mapping indoor environments using wireless signals. Adib was named byTechnology Review as one of the world’s top 35 innovators under 35 and by Forbes as 30 under 30. His research on wireless sensing (X-Ray Vision) was recognized as one of the 50 ways MIT has transformed Computer Science, and his work on robotic perception (Finder of Lost Things) was named as one of the 103 Ways MIT is Making a Better World. Adib’s commercialized technologies have been used to monitor thousands of patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and COVID19, and he has had the honor to demo his work to President Obama at the White House. Adib is also the recipient of various awards including the NSF CAREER Award (2019), the ONR Young Investigator Award (2019), the ONR Early Career Grant (2020), the Google Faculty Research Award (2017), the Sloan Research Fellowship (2021), and the ACM SIGMOBILE Rockstar Award (2022), and his research has received Best Paper/Demo Awards at SIGCOMM, MobiCom, and CHI. Adib received his Bachelors from the American University of Beirut (2011) and his PhD from MIT (2016), where his thesis won the Sprowls award for Best Doctoral Dissertation at MIT and the ACM SIGMOBILE Doctoral Dissertation Award.
