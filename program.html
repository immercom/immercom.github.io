<strong>Title</strong>: Towards Volumetric Video Conferencing<br/>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: With Social Extended Reality (XR) emerging as a new medium, where users can remotely experience immersive content with others, the vision of a true feeling of ‘being there together’ has become a realistic goal. This keynote will provide an overview about the challenges to achieve such a goal, based on results from practical case studies like the <a href="https://transmixr.eu">TRANSMIXR</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/zzB7B6EAU9c">MediaScape XR</a> projects. 
	We will discuss about different technologies, like point clouds, that can be used as the format for representing highly-realistic digital humans, and about metrics and protocols for quantifying the quality of experience. The final intention of the talk is to shed some light on social XR, as a new group of virtual reality experiences based on social photorealistic immersive content. We will discuss about the challenges regarding production and user-centric processes, and discover the new opportunities open by this new medium.<br/>
<strong>Speaker Bio</strong>: Pablo Cesar has led the Distributed and Interactive Systems (DIS) group at CWI since January 2014 and is Professor of Human-Centered Multimedia Systems in the Department of Intelligent Systems (INSY) at TU Delft.
