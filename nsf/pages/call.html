                    <p>We seek to foster cross-disciplinary dialogue and drive innovation in building the next generation of 
			network infrastructures and systems that can meet the demands of immersive applications.
			</p>


			<p>Position papers should address one or more of the following focus topics:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Intelligent Network Design</b>: AI and ML have the potential to optimize network performance for immersive applications 
				by dynamically adapting configurations and efficiently allocating resources. We encourage submissions that explore 
				how AI/ML can drive intelligent, self-optimizing networks for immersive experiences.</li>

			<li><b>Distributed Systems and Edge Computing</b>: Immersive applications often require real-time data processing and low-latency 
				interactions, which demand advanced distributed systems and edge computing solutions. We seek contributions that 
				explore the integration of cloud and edge computing, dynamic workload distribution, and optimization techniques for 
				processing immersive content in real time.</li>

			<li><b>5G and Beyond</b>: Position papers that examine how 5G, network slicing, and future communication technologies can support 
				the low-latency, high-reliability needs of immersive computing are welcome. We are particularly interested in 
				cross-layer optimization and the integration of heterogeneous networks to create seamless connectivity.</li>

			<li><b>Performance Optimization in Immersive Systems</b>: The performance of immersive computing systems hinges on efficient 
				resource allocation, low latency, and energy optimization. We invite position papers on resource management 
				strategies, dynamic scaling of compute resources, and techniques for minimizing power consumption while maintaining 
				high-performance levels in XR environments.</li>
				
			<li><b>Network Protocols</b>: Immersive computing places unique demands on network protocols, requiring ultra-low latency, 
				high bandwidth, and efficient data handling. We seek contributions on novel communication protocols, data 
				compression techniques, and enhancements to transport layer protocols optimized for immersive environments.</li>

			<li><b>Scalability and Sustainability in Immersive Systems</b>: As immersive technologies scale, ensuring sustainability 
				and long-term viability becomes increasingly important. We invite position papers that discuss scalable system 
				designs, resource-efficient solutions, and methods to reduce the environmental footprint of immersive systems while 
				maintaining high-performance and user satisfaction.</li>
				
			<li><b>Network Measurement</b>: Measuring and optimizing the performance of networks in immersive contexts is increasingly complex. 
				We invite submissions that introduce novel methodologies, tools, and metrics for assessing latency, bandwidth, 
				quality of service, and user experience in immersive environments.</li>

			<li><b>Tools and Testbeds for Immersive Systems</b>: The development and evaluation of immersive systems require specialized 
				tools and testbeds. We encourage submissions that detail experiences in designing and deploying testbeds, simulation 
				environments, and benchmarking tools for immersive applications, with a focus on scalability, reproducibility, and 
				practical challenges.</li>
				
			<li><b>Security, Privacy, and Safety</b>: Immersive technologies introduce new security, privacy, and ethical concerns. We 
				welcome submissions on innovative solutions to protect user data, ensure safe immersive environments, and address 
				ethical challenges in XR applications.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2> Submission Guidelines </h2>

			<p>Position papers should be 2 pages in length, outlining current research, challenges, and potential solutions within 
				the focus areas listed above. We encourage submissions from both academia and industry to contribute diverse 
				perspectives on the future of immersive computing.</p>
