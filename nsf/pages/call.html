                    <p>We seek to foster cross-disciplinary dialogue and drive innovation in building the next generation of 
			network infrastructures and systems that can meet the demands of immersive applications.
			</p>


			<p>Position papers should address one or more of the following focus topics:</p>
			<ul>

			<li><b>Intelligent Network Design</b>: AI and ML offer new ways to optimize network performance for immersive applications. 
				We encourage submissions exploring how AI/ML can enable intelligent, self-optimizing networks that adapt dynamically 
				and efficiently allocate resources for immersive experiences.</li>

			<li><b>Distributed Systems and Edge Computing</b>: Immersive applications demand real-time data processing and low-latency 
				interactions. We seek contributions on integrating cloud and edge computing, dynamic workload distribution, and 
				optimization techniques for real-time immersive content processing.</li>

			<li><b>5G and Future Networks</b>: Advances in 5G, network slicing, and next-gen communication technologies are critical for 
				immersive computing. We welcome position papers that investigate cross-layer optimization and the integration of 
				heterogeneous networks for seamless connectivity.</li>

			<li><b>Performance Optimization for Immersive Systems</b>: Efficient resource management, low latency, and energy optimization 
				are key for immersive systems. We invite papers on resource allocation strategies, dynamic scaling, and techniques to 
				minimize power consumption while maintaining high performance.</li>

			<li><b>Network Protocols for Immersive Applications</b>: Immersive computing imposes unique requirements on network protocols, 
				such as ultra-low latency and high bandwidth. We seek contributions on novel communication protocols, data compression 
				techniques, and transport layer optimizations tailored for immersive environments.</li>

			<li><b>Scalability and Sustainability in Immersive Systems</b>: As immersive technologies expand, ensuring scalability and 
				sustainability becomes essential. We encourage submissions addressing scalable system designs, resource efficiency, 
				and strategies to reduce the environmental impact while maintaining performance.</li>

			<li><b>Network Measurement for Immersive Environments</b>: Measuring and optimizing network performance in immersive contexts 
				is increasingly complex. We invite papers on new methodologies, tools, and metrics for assessing latency, bandwidth, 
				quality of service, and user experience in immersive environments.</li>

			<li><b>Tools and Testbeds for Immersive Systems</b>: Specialized tools and testbeds are necessary for immersive systems 
				research. We welcome contributions that share experiences in designing and deploying testbeds, simulation environments, 
				and benchmarking tools with a focus on scalability, reproducibility, and practical challenges.</li>

			<li><b>Security, Privacy, and Safety in Immersive Technologies</b>: Immersive technologies introduce new challenges related to 
				security, privacy, and safety. We seek innovative solutions for protecting user data, ensuring safe immersive 
				environments, and addressing ethical issues in XR applications.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2> Submission Guidelines </h2>

			<p>Position papers should be 2 pages in length, outlining current research, challenges, and potential solutions within 
				the focus areas listed above. We encourage submissions from both academia and industry to contribute diverse 
				perspectives on the future of immersive computing.</p>
