                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to the  NSF Workshop on Networking and Systems Challenges in Immersive Computing. The workshop will be held on March 31st and April 1st at George Mason University's Van Metre Hall located at 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA. </p> 
                    <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, immersive computing stands as a transformative force,
reshaping human experiences, communication, and innovation. By creating highly interactive
and engaging experiences for users, immersive computing integrates digital information and content
into their physical environment with technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality
(VR/AR/MR), which are typically referred to as extended reality (XR). To harness the full potential
of this frontier, it is imperative to establish a thriving and interconnected community of researchers,
dedicated to addressing the networking and systems challenges in immersive computing. Our visioning workshop aims at
building this community and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to identify and explore the
most promising horizons in addressing these challenges. 

			<p> This workshop will be designed to achieve the following key objectives:
<ul>				
<li> <b>Strategic Research Initiatives</b>: We intend to pinpoint possible solutions addressing challenges in
networking, systems, and associated technologies of immersive computing. This initiative is geared
towards maintaining the United Statesâ€™ leadership in innovation. We plan to develop a scientific
agenda that identifies new or under-served problem areas, offering valuable insights to NSF.</li>
<li> <b>Education and Outreach</b>: Nurturing the next generation of researchers is paramount. The workshop
includes educational and outreach initiatives aimed at disseminating knowledge about the importance
of immersive computing and generating interest, engagement, and awareness among researchers,
students, and industry professionals.</li>
<li> <b>Community Building</b>: Building interdisciplinary teams and, crucially, maintaining their longevity
over extended durations present significant challenges. Our goal is to establish a collaborative ecosystem
that fosters a well-connected community of researchers across academia, industry, and government.
This interconnected network will catalyze interdisciplinary research, innovation, and the exchange
of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
